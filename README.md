This Python script is designed to analyze and visualize inflammation data extracted from CSV files. Utilizing NumPy for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization, the script provides several functionalities: loading data from CSV files, plotting individual patient data, and generating aggregate statistics including average, maximum, and minimum inflammation levels. It also enables the comparison of inflammation metrics between different datasets and combines multiple files to produce composite statistics. Additionally, the script categorizes files based on naming conventions to facilitate data organization. This comprehensive tool offers a robust framework for examining and comparing inflammation trends, making it particularly valuable for medical research and data analysis.
